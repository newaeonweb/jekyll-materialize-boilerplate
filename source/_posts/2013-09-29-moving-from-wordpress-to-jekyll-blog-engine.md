#How i was forced to move from Wordpress to Jekyll blog engine.
Some time ago, i had a conversation with an old friend and he ask me a good question:
> Did you hear about Jekyll blog engine?
> Everybody in community are using.

So after some troubles with my old hosting company i decide to move all my stuff from **Wordpress** to **Jekyll** using the **Github Pages**.
My experience was very good since Github have native support for Jekyll engine and the markdown syntax is very very funny to write and easy of course.
I just picked up a theme and made some changes, ok as i front-end i should make my own theme, but i'm very busy now and don't have so much free time to building the stuff from the scratch, sorry.

Well, that's all for now.

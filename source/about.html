                            Learning Single-page Web Application Development is a journey through application development using the MEAN stack with JavaScript on the server side and client side, covering concepts such as RESTful, authentication and session on SPA. You will build large-scale applications. You will use a JavaScript environment with Node.js on the server, MongoDB as the database, and AngularJS on the frontend.
                            Everything is integrated with the Bower dependency manager, Yeoman, and other modern tools to speed up your development process. You will deploy your application to the cloud and learn how to prepare your directory structure to scale and grow.
                            Learning Single-page Web Application Development will give you an overview of AngularJS and RESTful APIs, and guide you in learning how to leverage single page development tools to create efficient and effective applications.
